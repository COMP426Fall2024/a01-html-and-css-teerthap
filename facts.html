    <li>Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus, king of the Myrmidons, and the sea nymph Thetis. His divine lineage made him partly god.</li>
    <li>His mother, Thetis, tried to make Achilles immortal by dipping him into the River Styx. However, she held him by his heel, leaving it vulnerable. This is the origin of the term “Achilles’ heel,” meaning a person’s point of weakness.</li>
    <li>Achilles was considered the mightiest warrior in the Greek army during the Trojan War. His combat skills and strength were unmatched.</li>
    <li>To avoid joining the Trojan War, Thetis disguised Achilles as a girl and hid him among the daughters of King Lycomedes. However, the Greek hero Odysseus cleverly discovered him and persuaded him to join the war.</li>
    <li>His wrath, especially following the death of his close friend Patroclus, is one of the central themes of Homer’s epic, The Iliad. His anger and grief propelled him to take brutal revenge on Hector, the Trojan prince who killed Patroclus.</li>
    <li>Achilles had a deep bond with Patroclus. Some interpretations suggest they were more than friends, seeing their relationship as romantic, though ancient texts leave it ambiguous.</li>
    <li>Crafted by the god Hephaestus, Achilles’ shield was a masterpiece described in detail by Homer. It depicted the cosmos and the human world, highlighting his godlike status and connection to fate.</li>
    <li>Despite his vulnerable heel, Achilles was largely invulnerable, making him almost unbeatable in battle. His death only came about through his weak spot, the famous "Achilles' heel."</li>
    <li>Achilles met his end when Paris, the prince of Troy, shot an arrow (sometimes said to be guided by Apollo) into his vulnerable heel.</li>
    <li>After his death, Achilles was honored as a hero and was said to dwell in the Elysian Fields or on the White Island, enjoying a form of eternal life.</li>
    <li>The tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel is called the Achilles tendon, named after the hero due to the story of his heel being his only weakness.</li>
    <li>Achilles led a group of warriors called the Myrmidons, fierce soldiers known for their loyalty and bravery in the Trojan War.</li>
    <li>At one point during the Trojan War, Achilles refused to fight because he felt disrespected by Agamemnon, the Greek leader. His absence from the battlefield greatly weakened the Greek forces.</li>
    <li>Achilles has inspired numerous works of literature, art, film, and popular culture. He remains one of the most enduring figures of Greek mythology.</li>
