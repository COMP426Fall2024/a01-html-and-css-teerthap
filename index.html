        <h2>Who is Achilles</h2>
        <p> Achilles, a hero of the Trojan War in Greek mythology, was renowned as the most formidable of all Greek warriors. He was the central figure in Homer's Iliad and the offspring of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the illustrious king of Phthia and a member of the renowned Argonauts. Raised in Phthia, Achilles was brought up alongside his childhood friend Patroclus and was educated by the centaur Chiron. In the Iliad, he is depicted as the leader of the legendary Myrmidons.
        </p>
        <p>Achilles' most famous accomplishment in the Trojan War involved killing the Trojan prince Hector just outside Troy's gates. Although the Iliad does not depict Achilles' death, other sources agree that he was slain towards the end of the war by Paris, who shot him with an arrow. Subsequent legends (starting with Statius' incomplete epic Achilleid from the 1st century AD) claim that Achilles was invincible throughout his body except for his heel. According to this myth, when his mother Thetis submerged him in the river Styx as a baby, she held him by one heel, leaving it vulnerable as the only part untouched by the waters.
        </p>
        <p>The term "Achilles' heel" refers to a point of weakness that can cause downfall, particularly in someone or something that is otherwise strong. The Achilles tendon is named after him based on the same legend due to it being the cause of his death.
